## Data Description

This is a supplementary dataset for the paper _A quantitative assessment of snow shielding effects on surface exposure dating from a western North American 10Be data compilation_ by Shan Ye et al. on the _Quaternary Geochronology_.

We provide a data file containing the snow correction factors calculated from our time-integrated snow data in the western North America. The file is in [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) format which can be viewed and processed in geospatial software (e.g. Panoply, ArcGIS and QGIS) or by programming languages (e.g. Python, MATLAB and R). The dimension of the file is 80 (lon) * 60 (lat) * 45 (time). Please note that our data are not for telling a specific correction factor at a given sample site but for serving as a guide for future research plans. When comparing regional glacier responses, these data will guide the understanding of the magnitude of snow-related uncertainties in different regions, which may affect the interpretation of the results. When designing a dating project, these data will guide the planning as to how much effort should be expended to quantify the impact of snow shielding.
