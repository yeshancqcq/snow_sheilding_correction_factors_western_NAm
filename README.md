## Data Description

We provide a data file containing the correction factors calculated from our time-integrated snow data in the western North America. These files are in [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) format which can be viewed and processed in geospatial software (e.g. Panoply, ArcGIS and QGIS) or by programming languages (e.g. Python, MATLAB and R). The dimension of the file is 80 (lon) * 60 (lat) * 45 (time). Please note that these raster files are not for telling a specific correction factor at a given sample site but for serving as a guide for future research plans. When comparing regional glacier responses, these files will guide the understanding of the magnitude of snow-related uncertainties in different regions, which may affect the interpretation of the results. When designing a dating project, these files will guide the planning as to how much effort should be expended to quantify the impact of snow shielding.
