## Data Description

We provide a series of raster files containing the correction factors calculated from our time-integrated snow data. These files are in [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) format which can be viewed and processed in geospatial software (e.g. ArcGIS and QGIS) or by programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, and R). They contain spatial information so no georeferencing is needed. Each file corresponds to a 500-year time bin which is indicated by the file name. For example, the file c20000.tif is the accumulated correction factors from 20000 years b.p. to the present, while the file c5000.tif is the accumulated correction factors from 5000 years b.p. to the present. The surface is interpolated from data points of the TraCE-21ka model output by the Kriging method with a cell size of 0.1 degrees. Please note that these raster files are not for telling a specific correction factor at a given sample site but for serving as a guide for future research plans. When comparing regional glacier responses, these files will guide the understanding of the magnitude of snow-related uncertainties in different regions, which may affect the interpretation of the results. When designing a dating project, these files will guide the planning as to how much effort should be expended to quantify the impact of snow shielding.
